;; NOTE: I don't let this file be automatically created and written
;; to.  This is a tradeoff, as I now have to add things in here
;; manually whenever I need an abbrev.  But I can then have
;; mode-specific abbreviations next to their configs without clashing
;; with this file.  Hence only global abbrevs go here, which are
;; mostly typos I often make.
